    ProcessPoolExecutor uses the multiprocessing module. Multiprocessing forks processes,
    causing connection objects to be copied across processes. The key goal when running
    multiple Python processes is to prevent any database connections from being shared
    across processes. Depending on specifics of the driver and OS, the issues that arise
    here range from non-working connections to socket connections that are used by multiple
    processes concurrently, leading to broken messaging (e.g., 'MySQL server has gone away').

    To get around this, we force each process to open its own connection to the database by
    closing the existing, copied connection as soon as we're within the new process. This works
    because as long as there is no existing, open connection, Django is smart enough to initialize
    a new connection the next time one is necessary.
