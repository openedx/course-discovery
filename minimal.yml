#
# This is the minimal settings you need to set to be able to get django to
# load when using the production.py settings files. It's useful to point
# DISCOVERY_CFG to this file to be able to run various paver commands
# without needing a full docker setup.
#
# Follow up work will likely be done as a part of
# https://github.com/openedx/wg-developer-experience/issues/136
